## Project Objective

The research will be focused on the emotional impact of events (crashes, overtakes, pit strategies, etc.) during a Formula 1 race/weekend on the twitter activity of people who watch that race. With those results, (advertising) companies can use those twitter peak moments for the optimization for their advertisements.

## Research Question

How do events during a Formula 1 race/weekend emotionally impact the twitter activity?

**Sub-Questions:** (if any)

None

## Type of Question

The research question I will answer is a descriptive question.

## Data

I have downloaded the necessary data for this project. The script to download the data is [`data/download-data.R`](data/download-data.R)^]

## Data Description

The data that will be used in this research is a database existing of tweets concerning the Formula 1 weekend and race. The tweets are worldwide tweets, since drivers, teams, and circuits are from all over the world, however, to make the data more understandable, only English written tweets have been searched for. The data set consists of 4623 rows and 90 columns. The most important columns of the data set would be: 'created at', 'screen name', 'text', 'source', 'hastags'.
